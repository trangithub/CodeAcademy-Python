# Define a function called count that has two arguments called sequence and item.
# Return the number of times the item occurs in the list.
# For example: count([1, 2, 1, 1], 1) should return 3 (because 1 appears 3 times in the list).

def count(sequence,item):
 
  sum = 0
  for i in sequence:
    if i == item:
      sum +=1
  return sum
print count([1,2,3,4,4],4)
